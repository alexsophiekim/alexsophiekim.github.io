          <h3>1. Were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
          <br/>
          <P>
            The JavaScript Kata task is a bit hard for me. I’ve been stuck on the 4-gradebook challenge. I’ve tried many times to solve it, and while I found some information, I mostly couldn’t find the solutions I needed. I asked my facilitator for help, and I realized that I had just missed small pieces and messed up the syntax or used the wrong parameter.
          </P> 
          <br/>
          <h3>2. Elegantly solved a problem.</h3><br/>
          <p>I got stuck at several points while writing the code. I wasn’t sure about the syntax and what I should be writing. So, I watched some basic method lessons on YouTube and tried to apply what I learned, but it didn’t work. I then searched Google and looked at someone else's code on Stack Overflow, but I still had no luck. Eventually, I asked my tutor for help and shared my code, and it turned out I had only missed a small part. </p>
          <br/>
          <h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
          <br/>
          <p>
            I still can’t feel confident because I’m not 100% sure, even after watching and learning about methods and how to use functions and flow. I read the pseudocode before I start and try to fully understand the tasks. I attempt to apply what I know, and if it doesn’t work, I use console.log and do a lot of Googling. In the end, I need to ask my facilitator for help.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <h3>4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h3>
          <br/>
          <p>
            I hesitated to ask for help during every moment I got stuck because I didn’t know how to articulate my questions. So, I dug deep before asking and read the pseudocode many times. I shared my code with my facilitator to help them understand where I was struggling. I wanted to solve the problems myself, but I couldn’t stay stuck for long, so I did a lot of digging on my own before asking for help. Maybe I need to build a stronger foundation first, and then I’ll be able to dig deeper on my own.
          </P>
