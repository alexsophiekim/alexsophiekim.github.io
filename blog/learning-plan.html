            <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I have worked as a UX and Digital Designer for the past four years, which has been an exciting experience. 
            However, with the economy being unstable and the tech industry experiencing a slowdown, many small companies are shutting down, leading to a reduced demand for design roles.
            Given these circumstances, I believe now is the perfect time to upskill and stay current with industry trends. 
            I am eager to enhance my abilities and have chosen to focus on development skills as my armour.
            I already have a basic understanding of web development from before I entered the tech industry.
            I also enjoy building apps and collaborating with cross-functional teams. 
            My goal is to become an engineer who leverages technical skills for long-term career growth, particularly in the evolving fields of AI, data, and cloud technologies.

            2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            My the best strengths is resilience for the current situation. I always believe it will be passing even if the bad situation.
            After redundant my last role and during unemployment moment, I keep seeking and applying the jobs. At the same time, I learnt Microsoft Azure fundamentals AZ-900 and AI as well.
            And I taugth Python myself. I trying to go over it with positive way. 
            But sometimes really hard to hold me with lack of skill and knowledge which is my limitation I guess. So I would love to enhance and improve for my mental and mind calm.

        <p>
            I would love to expose me communication with others and socializing and get involved connections.
            I remember old collegue mentioned the connection is really important but as an immigrator I am not too sure how to join in and use it.

            6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I am joining this bootcamp because I want to secure a stable tech job with a reliable company. 
            I know that many former students have successfully found great tech positions after completing this course, and I hope to become one of them.
            My development knowledge is currently at a basic level. My challenge is that I am unsure how to apply what I know. 
            When faced with a problem, I often don't know how to solve it with code. 
            Therefore, I am eager to learn and gain more experience.
            Additionally, I may be moving to Australia with my family. 
            I will need to consider companies that offer flexibility for relocation between Australia and New Zealand. 
            I hope the facilitation team can assist me with this.

            7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
            For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

        <p>
            I  am fairly flexible, but I teach yoga every Friday evening. I also enjoy attending a 9am yoga class at the studio. 
            Additionally, I occasionally have casual design work, so my schedule can vary. 
            However, I will definitely prioritize this course.
