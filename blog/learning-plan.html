        <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I have worked as a UX and Digital Designer for the past four years, which has been an exciting experience. 
            However, with the economy being unstable and the tech industry experiencing a slowdown, many small companies are shutting down, leading to a reduced demand for design roles.
            Given these circumstances, I believe now is the perfect time to upskill and stay current with industry trends. 
            I am eager to enhance my abilities and have chosen to focus on development skills as my armour.
            I already have a basic understanding of web development from before I entered the tech industry.
            I also enjoy building apps and collaborating with cross-functional teams. 
            My goal is to become an engineer who leverages technical skills for long-term career growth, particularly in the evolving fields of AI, data, and cloud technologies.
        </p>

            2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            My the best strengths is resilience for the current situation. I always believe it will be passing even if the bad situation.
            After redundant my last role and during unemployment moment, I keep seeking and applying the jobs. At the same time, I learnt Microsoft Azure fundamentals AZ-900 and AI as well.
            I self-taugth Python myself. I trying to go over it with positive way. 
            But sometimes really hard to hold me with lack of skill and knowledge which is my limitation I guess. So I would love to enhance and improve for my mental and mind calm. 
        </p>

            3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?        
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I would love to expose me communication with others and socializing and get involved connections.
            I remember old collegue mentioned the connection is really important but as an immigrator I am not too sure how to join in and use it.

            4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:        
        </h3>
        <h5 style="font-weight: 100;line-height:1.4;color:silver">
            - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
        <br/>
            - What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
        </h5>
        <br/>
        <P>
            To manage my workload effectively in this program, I’ll use organization tools like a Kanban board and calendar to set weekly goals and track deadlines. I’m comfortable with Agile methods and will utilize daily standups to stay aligned with the team and address any blockers. <br/>

            My schedule includes teaching yoga every Friday evening and occasionally covering other classes, but otherwise, I’m flexible. When things get overwhelming, I’ll prioritize tasks, take breaks, and practice stress-relief techniques such as exercise and mindfulness. If needed, I’ll seek support from facilitators or peers to ensure I stay on track and balanced throughout the program.
        </P>

            5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way        
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I’ll seek help promptly by reaching out to facilitators or peers through via discode. If I need immediate assistance, I’ll flick the DM or set up quick meetings to address issues. I'm also open to feedback and will proactively ask for support during group discussions or through the channels when needed.
        </p>

            6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I am joining this bootcamp because I want to secure a stable tech job with a reliable company. 
            I know that many former students have successfully found great tech positions after completing this course, and I hope to become one of them.
            My development knowledge is currently at a basic level. My challenge is that I am unsure how to apply what I know. 
            When faced with a problem, I often don't know how to solve it with code. 
            Therefore, I am eager to learn and gain more experience.
            Additionally, I may be moving to Australia with my family. 
            I will need to consider companies that offer flexibility for relocation between Australia and New Zealand. 
            I hope the facilitation team can assist me with this.        
        </p>

            7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
            For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.        
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I  am fairly flexible, but I teach yoga every Friday evening. I also enjoy attending a 9am yoga class at the studio. 
            Additionally, I occasionally have casual design work, so my schedule can vary. 
            However, I will definitely prioritize this course.
