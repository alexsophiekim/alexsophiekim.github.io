              <li>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</li><br/>
              <p>
                1. I have tried to solve the problem myself and keep giving it a go, even though it's not working, which has frustrated me.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. I have learned which specific areas I lack knowledge or confidence in during the challenge, so I prepared to recap and tried to do it again and again even the wee bite size. 
              </p>
              <p>
                3. I love the concepts of neuroplasticity and a growth mindset, which help me reset my thinking. I hadn't realized how important they are until I read the article and researched these topics. I realized that my mindset has been somewhat static, and I can be impatient during the learning process, sometimes being a bit harsh on myself.
              </p><br/>
              <li>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</li><br/>
              <p>
                In learning and programming is not simple and easy. I need to build up the basic knowledges before jump into the challenges and I need to try over and over again until I found solution. I often need to try repeatedly until I find a solution. Sometimes, I get stuck and feel frustrated, disappointed, or unsure. However, by persisting through the learning and trial process, I eventually discover the way to solve the problem.
              </p>
              <br/>
              
              <li>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
              </li><br/>
              <p>
                Growth Mindset! I didn't realize that my mindset wasn't very positive. I often tested and judged my knowledge level. After reading the article, I reset my mindset to focus more on growth. I understand that it's okay not to know everything clearly; it will take time for me to absorb the information. I believe that my effort and time will help me succeed.
              </p><br/>
              <li>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</li>
              <p>
                Research and reflection take time. I first need to examine myself and my habits, then identify what changes I need to make. 
              </p><br/>
              <li>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</li><br/>
              <p>
                I guess the mindset is really important part during the new skills learning moment. It's new to me of course I feel frustrated and uncomfortable with new knowledge and unsure moment. I need to set my mind as a growthful.
              </p><br/>
              <li>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</li><br/>
              <p>
                Itâ€™s a bit doubtful. Learning human skills is definitely worth for a lifetime. But since this is a bootcamp with a limited timeframe, I feel a bit rushed to accomplish everything. If it were a one-year course, I would truly enjoy the journey of learning human skills.
